question: what if i need a data structure that allows duplicates but i dont care about the order like an arraylist.
For my clauses data structure.

Things to do:
Create a Main that does all the looping through the formulas instead of doing that in each class.

Rules:
If one of the clauses is 0, it will never be sat
For a pure literal, any clauses that the pure literal is in can be removed (Is this true????)
