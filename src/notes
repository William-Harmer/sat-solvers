question: what if i need a data structure that allows duplicates but i dont care about the order like an arraylist.
For my clauses data structure.

If one of the clauses is 0, it will never be sat
For a pure literal, any clauses that the pure literal is in can be removed

DPLL:
unit prop
Any literal that is pure literal, remove those clauses and assign truth value to that literal (Do that for all pure literals)
then brute force

unit prop
pure literal elim




My own personal method:
unit prop
then pure literal elm
then brute force with early stopping
