question: what if i need a data structure that allows duplicates but i dont care about the order like an arraylist.
For my clauses data structure.

Things to do:
I need to add the fact that if there are empty clauses, that means that it is unsat.
Create a Main that does all the looping through the formulas instead of doing that in each class.
Need to add something in pureliteral elim that takes into account if a pure literal completely removes oher literals that dont have truth values

DPLL??:
unit prop
Any literal that is pure literal, remove those clauses and assign truth value to that literal (Do that for all pure literals)
then brute force (Instead of brute force can you make it so that as soon as a clause is set as positive it skips???)

Rules:
If one of the clauses is 0, it will never be sat
For a pure literal, any clauses that the pure literal is in can be removed
