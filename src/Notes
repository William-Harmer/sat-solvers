400 literal places is good for brute forces it takes about 200 seconds
I did change DPLL so that it doesnt make copies so keep an eye out if there are problems with that

To do:
- Figure out CDCL

- Change the deafult UnitPropogation to allow duplicates when removing elements of the opposite polarity
- Look into unit prop breaking early if you remove last element in a clause
