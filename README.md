**Note:** This project is a work in progress and is still being developed. Updates and improvements are ongoing.

This is my undergraduate dissertation project, where I aim to develop a series of satisfiability (SAT) solvers, starting with basic implementations and progressing towards the further optimised solvers we have today. My solvers will handle formulas expressed in conjunctive normal form (CNF).

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of these solvers through various metrics, with the two most significant being time and space. To achieve this, I will create a comprehensive dataset comprising hundreds of CNF formulas, which I will then be able to test each solver against. Through this analysis, I aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each solver, determine which solver performs best overall, and uncover specific instances where certain solvers unexpectedly outperform others, along with an exploration of the underlying reasons for these variations.

This project was inspired by the **SAT Competition**, an annual event that benchmarks and evaluates the performance of SAT solvers across a variety of CNF formulas, focusing on metrics such as runtime, memory usage, and robustness. The competitive nature of this event motivated me to explore the development and optimization of SAT solvers in more detail, with the goal of starting to understand how they work and the factors that influence their efficiency.
